# Friend Management Api

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/f935b8d4a9024aa79325fb3f3cd04110)](https://app.codacy.com/app/sudarsan.a/friendmanagement?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=isudarsan/friendmanagement&utm_campaign=badger)

This is an application with a need to build its own social network, "Friends Management" is a common requirement which usually starts off simple but can grow in complexity depending on the application's use case.
Usually, the application compraised of features like "Friend", "Unfriend", "Block", "Receive Updates" etc.

## Technology Choice

### Spring Boot
1. Spring Boot allows easy setup of standalone Spring-based applications. 
2. Ideal for spinning up microservices and easy to deploy. 
3. Makes data access less of a pain, i.e. JPA mappings through Spring Data. 

### Swagger
1. Swagger is a framework for describing API using a common language that everyone can understand. 
2. The Swagger spec standardizes API practices, how to define parameters, paths, responses, models, etc.

### AWS
1. The Free Tier; which provides enough credit to run an EC2 micro instance 24/7 all month.
2. It comes with S3 storage, EC2 compute hours, Elastic Load Balancer time, and much more. 
3. This gives a chance to try out AWS in our software

## Deployment to AWS-EC2

The Application is deployed on AWS - EC2 instance.It can be accessed via the below url and the path for all the api is `/firendsapi`
http://ec2-18-216-161-170.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080

For example: To access `/firends` endpoint, the URL should be:

http://ec2-18-216-161-170.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/firendsapi/friends

Swagger UI is configured for the app and it is available: http://ec2-18-216-161-170.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/swagger-ui.html

Jenkins is configured on EC2 to build and deploy snapshots for the friendmanagement micro service.Trigger the below job so that it will automatically deploy and run the microservice on EC2.

http://ec2-18-216-161-170.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9090/job/RELEASE_FRIEND_MGMT/

Credentials : sudarsan/cg@123

### Deployment using Docker

First step is to run MySQL in Docker container, use below command.

`docker run --name mysql-friend-management-containar -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=friend_management -e MYSQL_USER=zarvis -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=password -d mysql:5.6`

1. `name` mysql-friend-management-containar to assign a name to the container.
2. `-e` to pass environment variables to the container, and create a `friend_management` database with a user username and password.         This user will be granted superuser permissions for the `friend_management` database.
3. `-p 3306:3306` to expose MySQL port to the local host.
4. `-d` to tell Docker to daemonize the container and keep it running.mysql:5.6 to download MySQL 5.6 Server image from Docker public        repo if not in your computer yet.

Now that we have defined the Dockerfile, build a docker image for our application. Type the following command from the root directory of the project to build the docker image

`$ docker build -t friendmanagement .`

Once we have a docker image, run and link with MySQL database container which we already create below command.

`$ docker run -p 8080:8080 --name friendmanagement --link mysql-friend-management-containar -d friendmanagement`

After that check the logs to make sure Server is running OK

`$ docker logs friendmanagement`

The application Docker image is also available in Docker Hub : https://hub.docker.com/r/isudarsan/zarvis-apps/tags/

Image can be pulled directly from Docker Hub using `docker pull isudarsan/zarvis-apps:friendmanagement-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`

### Note : Since the application deployed on AWS-Free Tier, the URLs might not work always :)

## Spring Boot Admin for monitoring

Configured spring boot admin for application monitoring, available at : http://http://ec2-18-188-249-225.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8093
